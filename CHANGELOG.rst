  (improvement)

  sensor mode. (improvement)

  search paths. (bug-fix)
* Update sensor container to use ``auth.api_url`` setting when talking to the API (e.g. when

v0.8.0 - March 2, 2015
----------------------

Docs: http://docs.stackstorm.com/0.8/

* Allow user to specify current working directory (``cwd`` parameter) when running actions using the
  local or the remote runner (``run-local``, ``run-local-script``, ``run-remote``,
  ``run-remote-script``). (new-feature)

  ``packs_base_paths`` setting. (new-feature)
* Allow user to specify which Python binary to use for the Python runner actions using
  ``actionrunner.python_binary`` setting (new-feature)
* Default Python binary which is used by Python runner actions to be the Python binary which is
  used by the action runner service. Previous, system's default Python binary was used.

  the environment variables accessible to the CLI to be sent as ``env`` parameter to the action
  being executed. (new-feature)
* Cast params of an execution before scheduling in the RulesEngine. This allows non-string
  parameters in an action. (new-feature)

  improve running time of API request. (bug-fix)
* CLI commands to return non-zero exit codes for failed operations (new-feature)
* Fix a bug with template rendering, under some conditions, ending in an infinite loop. (bug-fix)
* Rename ActionExecution to LiveAction. (refactor)

  performs not equals check on values of an arbitrary type. (new-feature)
* Mistral subworkflows kicked off in st2 should include task name. (bug-fix)
* Add new ``execution re-run <execution id>`` CLI command for re-running an
  existing action. (new-feature)

* Ability to see child tasks of any execution. (new-feature)
* Allow sensors to manage global datastore items via sensor_service by passing ``local=False``
  argument to the ``get_value``, ``set_value`` and ``delete_value`` methods. (new-feature)
* Allow sensors to list datastore items using ``list_values`` sensor_service method. (new-feature)

  parameter to the /keys endpoint. (new-feature)

  has triggered the action execution. (bug-fix)

v0.7 - January 16, 2015
-----------------------

Docs: http://docks.stackstorm.com/0.7/

* Python runner and all the fabric based runners (``run-local``, ``run-local-script``,
  ``run-remote``, ``run-remote-script``) now expose ``timeout`` argument. With this argument
  user can specify action timeout. Previously, the action timeout was not user-configurable and
  a system-wide default value was used.
* The time when an action execution has finished is now recorded and available via the
  ``end_timestamp`` attribute on the ``ActionExecution`` model.
* Status code 400 (bad request) is now returned if user doesn't provide a body to API endpoints
  which require it. Previously 500 internal server error was returned (bug-fix).
* Refactor local runners so they are more robust, efficient and easier to debug. Previously, local
  actions were executed through SSH, now they are executed directly without the overhead of SSH.
* Fix local runner so it correctly executes a command under the provider system user if ``user``
  parameter is provided. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug with a Trigger database object in some cases being created twice when registering a
  rule. (bug-fix)

  container service. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug and allow user to use non-ascii (unicode) values in the parameter substitution values.
  (bug-fix)
* Allow polling sensors to retrieve current poll interval and change it using ``get_poll_interval``
  and ``set_poll_interval`` methods respectively. (new-feature)
* Add support for a ``standalone`` mode to the st2auth service. In the standalone mode,
  authentication is handled inside the st2auth service using the defined backend. (new feature)
* Timer is not a sensor anymore. It is spun as part of rules_engine process (refactor)
* Fix a bug with action registration where action with invalid schema for
  parameters get registered. (bug-fix)
* Fix a bug with 'default' param values inheritance in runner/actions. (bug-fix)
* Add new rule criteria comparison operators: ``iequals``, ``contains``, ``icontains``,
  ``ncontains``, ``incontains``, ``startswith``, ``istartswith``, ``endswith``, ``iendswith``
  (new-feature)
* Allow sensors to store temporary data in the datastore using the ``get_value``, ``set_value`` and
  ``delete_value`` methods exposed by sensor_service. (new-feature)
* Allow user to specify TTL for datastore values by sending ``ttl`` attribute in the body of a
  `PUT /keys/<key id>` request. (new feature)
* Add new `key delete_by_prefix --prefix=<prefix>` client command. This command allows deletion of
  all the keys which name starts with the provided prefix. (new-feature)
* Add ability to attach tags to Action, Rule and TriggerType.
* Add ability to query results asynchronously from external services. (new-feature)
* Action models now use ContentPackResourceMixin so we can get them by ref. (refactor)
* Add ``rule_tester`` tool which allows users to test rules in an offline mode without any services
  running (new-feature)
* Fix a bug where trigger objects weren't created for triggers with different parameters. (bug-fix)
* st2api only requires st2common and dependencies defined in requirements to be available on the
  pythonpath thus making it possible to run st2api standalone.
* Add support for 'exists' and 'nexists' operators in rule criteria. (new-feature)

v0.6.0 - December 8, 2014
-------------------------

Docs: http://docs.stackstorm.com/0.6.0/

* Separate virtualenv per pack. (Pythonic sensors and actions use them by default.)
* Install pip requirements from requiremets.txt in packs by default.
* Sensors are now run in their own process for isolation.
* Python Actions are now run in their own process for isolation.
* Add Sensor and PollingSensor base classes. (Sensors API change is non-backward compatible.)
* Separate out rules_engine into own process.
* YAML support for action, rules and chain meta.
* Add sensor meta support (JSON/YAML) to specify trigger types.
* Packs default path moves from /opt/stackstorm to /opt/stackstorm/packs/.
* Webhooks are not part of a sensor. They are now part of core API. (Authentication may
  be required.)
* API URLs are now versioned. All the existing paths have been prefixed with ``/v1``
  (e.g. ``/v1/actions``).
* Audit log messages are now saved in a structured format as JSON in
  ``st2actionrunner.{pid}.audit.log`` log file.
